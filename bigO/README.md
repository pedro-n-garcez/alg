# Big O notation
A C# Console Application with some brief methods that exemplify common types of big O notation: constant, linear and quadratic. 

The O(1) runtime method accesses the first and last elements of the array, therefore size of input does not matter. 

The O(n) runtime method goes through every number in an array and adds them into a final sum. 

The O(n^2) runtime method is an implementation of bubble sort on an array.
