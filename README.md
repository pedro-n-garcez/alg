# alg 
C# implementation of algorithms for the PROG 366 class. The algorithms are divided into separate VS project folders. The projects included in this repository so far are:

Big O examples: Some brief methods that examplify common types of big O notation: constant, linear and quadratic.

Fisher-Yates shuffle: An implementation of the shuffling algorithm that reads a text file and outputs the lines in the file in a new, randomized order.
