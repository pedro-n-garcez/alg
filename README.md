# Algorithms
*C# implementation of algorithms for the PROG 366 class. The algorithms are divided into separate VS project folders. The projects included in this repository so far are:*

* **Big O examples**: Some brief methods that examplify common types of big O notation: constant, linear and quadratic.

* **Fisher-Yates shuffle**: An implementation of the shuffling algorithm that reads a text file and outputs the lines in the file in a new, randomized order.
