# Algorithms
*C# implementation of algorithms for the PROG 366 class. The algorithms are divided into separate VS project folders. The projects included in this repository so far are:*

* **bigO**: Some brief methods that exemplify common types of big O notation: constant, linear and quadratic. O(1) runtime accesses the first and last methods of the array, therefore size of input does not matter. O(n) runtime goes through every number in an array and adds them into a sum. O(n^2) runtime is an implementation of bubble sort.

* **fisher_yates**: An implementation of the Fisher-Yates shuffling algorithm, also known as the Knuth shuffle, that places every item in the collection into a new, random position. This implementation reads a plain text file and outputs the lines in the file in a randomized order.
