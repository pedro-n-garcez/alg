# Data Structures
A C# Console Application demonstrating data structures in the .NET Systems.Collections library. Comparisons between stacks (a last-in first-out structure) and queues (a first-in first-out structure), and between a two-dimensional array and a Hashtable for storage of data pairs are included. 

The data in these structures is read from external text files. 

The application allows the user to input a U.S. state and get the corresponding state capital. It also allows the user to visualize how U.S. states are organized in stacks and queues.
